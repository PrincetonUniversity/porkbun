    <P> PorkBun is a web application that allows Princeton students to have a more pleasant dining experience. 
    Particularly, the website offers students the ability to provide their preferred dishes and dining halls. 
    Based on the userâ€™s preferences, the site generates a daily menu that highlights dishes that match the user's
    preferences, and a dynamic weekly menu that highlights the top dining hall options for each meal of the week.

    <p> Provide passwords, including administrative access, if we will need them
    to experiment with your system.

    <i> Please make this as easy for us as possible.</i>  There are 30 projects so if
    we have to blow 15 minutes figuring out how to run each system, that's one day wasted.

    <P> Please contact ... in case something goes wrong.
